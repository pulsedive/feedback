# We welcome your feedback!
This public repository was created so users can give us feedback. We are just trying this out for now to see how it goes. Users can:
- Report bugs
- Request a new feature
- Suggest a design change

**In order to provide feedback, please create an issue and assign it a label.**

If we accept the suggestion, we may assign our own labels to keep track of it. There is no guarantee when we will implement the suggestion, but we will try to keep the issue updated with our progress.

We may also close the issue for one of the following reasons:
- We were already planning to implement it.
- There is a duplicate issue already open.
- The suggestion does not align with our roadmap.

## Expectations
Depending on the volume, we may take some time to respond as we have quite a bit on our to do list and roadmap to get done!

## Contact
If you would like to get in contact with us, or chat with us directly, we welcome this too!
